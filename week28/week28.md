**1. Outline one usability issue associated with the design of mobile devices.**

 One issue of usability in the design of mobile devices is the screen size. It makes many tasks impractical and difficult, as many websites and tools are not compatible with mobile devices. For example, Google Suite has many issues with its mobile applications. Although Google Docs and Gmail are very accessible, less-used apps such as Google Sheets and Google Forms are difficult to use on the small device. Since all these apps are part of one package, it is frustrating for users to try to switch between documents and only be able to fully access half of them. Furthermore, many older websites are harder to access on mobile devices. They do not have a mobile version, so the user needs to zoom in and scroll to see the full screen. This makes it often times less effecient than using a computer. Finally, people with large fingers or poor vision struggle with the size of the screen, as the UI is very small and therefore requires precision that not every user has.


**2. Q2. Construct a truth table for the following Boolean expression: `(A AND B) NOR C`**

|A|B|C|Z|
|-|-|-|-|
|0|0|0|1|
|0|1|0|1|
|1|0|0|1|
|1|1|1|0|


**3. Q3. Define the term protocol.**

Protocol is a defined structure or method to complete a specific task. Protocols make sure that everyone completing the task is doing it the same way. This not only ensures uniform results, but also safe and ethical working conditions and fair processes.


**4. Q4. Outline the role of the memory data register in the machine execution cycle.**

The memory data register is where numbers are stored in the machine execution cycle. The register is indexed so that the values can be called, changed, deleted, and stored. Without this, the cycle would not be able to store any values. This would make any computing impossible, as each cycle needs to build on the last one based on what is in the register.

** 5. Q5. A code for representing colours is used, where each colour is stored using 7 bits. State the number of different colours that can be represented. **
