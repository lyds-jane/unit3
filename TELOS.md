For this unit, I will be developping a web application that inventories Norwegian candies.

This program successfully passes the TELOS feasibility:

The project is **technically feasible**. We will be using the python language to code the application, and will use QT Designer
to design the look of the application. All the requirements of the application (storing information related to a specific candy,
organizing the various candies, and searching a candy) can be done with dictionaries and lists, and involve simple coding.

The project is **economically feasible**. None of the developping softwares need to be paid for, and since it is a web-based
application, the user does not need to pay to use it.

The project is **legally feasible**. There are no laws against creating an inventory for Norwegian candies.

The project is **operationally feasible**. There are no current operations in place that this will conflict with. Futhermore,
web-based applications will work on any device, regarless of the software.

The project is has a good **schedule**. This should take around a month to develop. There needs to be meetings with the client,
time to learn how to use QT designer, and some time to refine the use of python. Then, the program can be coded and designed in
a few weeks.
